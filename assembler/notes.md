# Steps to Implement NanoASM Assembler

1. Define the assembly language syntax and instruction set.
2. Implement a lexer to tokenize input lines.
3. Implement a parser to validate instructions and operands.
4. Add support for labels and build a symbol table.
5. Implement a two-pass assembly process to resolve labels.
6. Map instructions and operands to NanoVM bytecode format.
7. Write the generated bytecode to an output file.
8. Add error handling for invalid syntax, instructions, and labels.
9. Create sample assembly programs for testing.
10. Test the assembler output with NanoVM to verify correctness.
11. Document usage and instruction set for future reference.
